----------------

> The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three: 1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made. 2. The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations. 3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.

> 头脑的对简单概念的发挥，主要体现在以下三方面
> 一曰组合，将一些简单的概念组合成一个复合的概念。复杂正来源于此。
> 二曰关系，乃是将两个概念，无论是复杂的还是简单的，放在一起，一拖一，以便一起检视。
> 三曰抽象，就是实体中蕴含的有别于其他概念的真正概念分离出来。

> We are about to study the idea of a _computational process_. 

我们将要学习 **计算过程**。

> A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer's idea of a spirit. It cannot be seen or touched. It is not composed of matter at all. However, it is very real. It can perform intellectual work. It can answer questions. It can affect the world by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory. The programs we use to conjure processes are like a sorcerer's spells. They are carefully composed from symbolic expressions in arcane and esoteric _programming languages_ that prescribe the tasks we want our processes to perform.

计算过程如同仙人的法力，看不见摸不着，但又是实在的。或许它可以帮你在银行存钱，或者操纵工厂的机器人。我们用来施法咒语的叫做 **编程语言**。我们小心的组合字母，指尖流出晦涩的词句，用来驱动计算过程。

> A computational process, in a correctly working computer, executes programs precisely and accurately. Thus, like the sorcerer's apprentice, novice programmers must learn to understand and to anticipate the consequences of their conjuring. Even small errors (usually called bugs or glitches) in programs can have complex and unanticipated consequences.

正确的程序正确执行，不正确的程序，哪怕一个小bug，也可能有着复杂难料的行为结果。

> Fortunately, learning to program is considerably less dangerous than learning sorcery, because the spirits we deal with are conveniently contained in a secure way. Real-world programming, however, requires care, expertise, and wisdom. A small bug in a computer-aided design program, for example, can lead to the catastrophic collapse of an airplane or a dam or the self-destruction of an industrial robot.

幸好，学习编程远比学习魔法安全多了，你可以随便试不用担心魔法反噬。但是现实世界里，编程师们必须小心，专业，智慧。一个小bug就可能让飞机坠毁，机器自毁。
